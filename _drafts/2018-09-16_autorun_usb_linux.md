# Autorun a script when a USB is plugged in on Linux

I needed to design something so that when the user plugs in a USB containing a new version of our application he is prompted to run the upgrade program stored on the key.

I found information on stackoverflow, I designed a first solution based on the most popular answers, however when digging further I realized that most of the solutions provided were out-dated.
