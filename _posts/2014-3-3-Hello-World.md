I will post mostly on Oracle day to day stuff I am doing at work, so that I can document stuff for myself. Hopefully it can help other people also.

My core job is system engineer / Oracle DBA but I also spend a lot of time programming in React (or angular) and PHP (or nodejs). My currently favorite programming language is javascript.
